# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets

Sentiment analysis on social media platforms like Twitter has gained significant attention due to its potential in extracting valuable insights from user-generated content. This project focuses on leveraging the RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) model for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis Web Application is a user-friendly tool designed to analyze the sentiment of tweets entered by users using Flask in python. Here's a concise overview of how the project works:

1.User Interaction: Users access the web application through a web browser.

2.Input Tweet: Users enter a tweet they want to analyze into the provided input text area.

3.Server-Side Processing: The Flask web application running on the server receives the user's input.

4.Text Preprocessing: The input tweet is preprocessed to handle mentions, URLs, and other text cleaning tasks to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.

5.Sentiment Analysis Model: The preprocessed tweet is passed through a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, specifically "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" from Hugging Face Transformers.

6.Sentiment Prediction: The sentiment analysis model predicts the sentiment of the tweet, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.

7.Display Emoticon: The model also provides a emoji related to its prediction.

The project leverages pre-trained models and technologies to make sentiment analysis accessible to users in real-time.
It enables users to gain insights into the sentiment of tweets, making it valuable for monitoring trends, brand management, opinion research, and more.
