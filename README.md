# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets (Project Download Link is at the end of the file)

Sentiment analysis on social media platforms like Twitter has gained significant attention due to its potential in extracting valuable insights from user-generated content. This project focuses on leveraging the RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) model for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis Web Application is a user-friendly tool designed to analyze the sentiment of tweets entered by users using Flask in python. Here's a concise overview of how the project works:

1.User Interaction: Users access the web application through a web browser.

2.Input Tweet: Users enter a tweet they want to analyze into the provided input text area.

3.Server-Side Processing: The Flask web application running on the server receives the user's input.

4.Text Preprocessing: The input tweet is preprocessed to handle mentions, URLs, and other text cleaning tasks to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.

5.Sentiment Analysis Model: The preprocessed tweet is passed through a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, specifically "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" from Hugging Face Transformers.

6.Sentiment Prediction: The sentiment analysis model predicts the sentiment of the tweet, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.

7.Display Emoticon: The model also provides a emoji related to its prediction.

The project leverages pre-trained models and technologies to make sentiment analysis accessible to users in real-time.
It enables users to gain insights into the sentiment of tweets, making it valuable for monitoring trends, brand management, opinion research, and more.
